# react-forms
In this exercise, I learned how to create react Forms that provide feedback to the user regarding their input. 

I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

In this exercise, I learned and practiced: 
- Dealing with Form Submission and Getting User input Values
- Adding Basic Validation
- Providing Validation Feedback
- Handling the 'was touched' State
- Reacting to Lost Focus
- Refactoring and Deriving States 
- managing the Overall Form Validity
- Adding a Custom Input Hook to otsource repetitive logic

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74827533/173815764-4f4e3240-8da7-4e03-811e-68b3150b64c7.png)
